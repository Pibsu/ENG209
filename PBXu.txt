Plans:(for a compact and somehow concealable design of machete-style paper/popsicle mix weapon)
- Design will be based on the spetsnaz machete design modified with a broad/wide, rounded/solid tip
	- tip part will be made with larger mass than rest of body
	- to ensure center of mass is further away from handle
- Build technique will be based on Returacan's way of making paper prop swords
	- build will be based on past design of the paper short batons that I made
	- 10+ layers of paper?(to be changed); 3+ layers of popsicle stick external support per side?
- Full length must be somehow 27-30cm+ (about 11-12in.)?
- Handle length must be approx. 10-13cm
- Handle width must be approx. somehow larger or same with short batons (3cm+)
- Crossguards design must be one which a latch can be easily released from and must be small 
- Blade width(except yung bandang tip) must be approx. 4.5-5cm
- Tip blade width must be approx. 7.5cm+
